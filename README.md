# StudentScheduler
This was designed using ASP.Net and C#. I made this my 2nd semester in my freshman year of college. 

This was to be a course scheduling app with the intention of using it to track homework assignments for courses. 

You can add times and point values for each assignment to see how much study time is need to complete your tasks.

When assignments are removed and added the time and points are adjusted. 

You could add and remove courses as well. 

Loading a course will pull the assignments linked to that course.

This is just a static web app with no database connection. That was not required for the assignment.
